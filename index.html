    <h1><u>Life At Queen Elizabeth High School</u></h1>
    <p>I started highschool recently, so I haven't joined any clubs, teams, or groups. I do hang out with my friends at lunch everyday, because they aren't in any of my classes.</p>
    <p>I would say that overall, I am doing really well academically. Specifically, I have pretty high grades in math and chemistry. I believe that those are just my strongest subjects and I hope to continue doing well in them for the remainder of my high school years.</p>
