<p style="font-size:25px;"> My name is Reem Farthat, and I am a student at Queen Elizabeth High School. I believe that my education is very important and that it leads to a good and successful future. I was born and raised in Canada, but my parents are from Lebanon. I usually go visit Lebanon for the duratio  of the summer break. Covid-19 has really affected all of our lives drastically, and has changed the way we all percieve life. </p>

    <h1><u>Life At Queen Elizabeth High School</u></h1>
    <p>I started highschool recently, so I haven't joined any clubs, teams, or groups. I do hang out with my friends at lunch everyday, because they aren't in any of my classes.</p>
    <p>I would say that overall, I am doing really well academically. Specifically, I have pretty high grades in math and chemistry. I believe that those are just my strongest subjects and I hope to continue doing well in them for the remainder of my high school years.</p>
